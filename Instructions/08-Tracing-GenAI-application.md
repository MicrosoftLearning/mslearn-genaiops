# Analyze and debug your generative AI app with tracing

This exercise takes approximately **30 minutes**.

> **Note**: This exercise assumes some familiarity with Azure AI Foundry, which is why some instructions are intentionally less detailed to encourage more active exploration and hands-on learning.

## Introduction

In this exercise, you‚Äôll run a multi-step generative AI assistant that recommends hiking trips and suggests outdoor gear. You‚Äôll use the Azure AI Inference SDK‚Äôs tracing features to analyze how your application executes and identify key decision points made by the model and surrounding logic.

You‚Äôll interact with a deployed model to simulate a real user journey, trace each stage of the application from user input to model response to post-processing, and view the trace data in Azure AI Foundry. This will help you understand how tracing enhances observability, simplifies debugging, and supports performance optimization of generative AI applications.

## Set up the environment

To complete the tasks in this exercise, you need:

- An Azure AI Foundry hub,
- An Azure AI Foundry project,
- A deployed model (like GPT-4o),
- A connected Application Insights resource.

### Deploy a model in an Azure AI Foundry project

To quickly setup an Azure AI Foundry project, simple instructions to use the Azure AI Foundry portal UI are provided below.

1. In a web browser, open the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in using your Azure credentials.
1. In the home page, in the **Explore models and capabilities** section, search for the `gpt-4o` model; which we'll use in our project.
1. In the search results, select the **gpt-4o** model to see its details, and then at the top of the page for the model, select **Use this model**.
1. When prompted to create a project, enter a valid name for your project and expand **Advanced options**.
1. Select **Customize** and specify the following settings for your project:
    - **Azure AI Foundry resource**: *A valid name for your Azure AI Foundry resource*
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *Create or select a resource group*
    - **Region**: *Select any **AI Services supported location***\*

    > \* Some Azure AI resources are constrained by regional model quotas. In the event of a quota limit being exceeded later in the exercise, there's a possibility you may need to create another resource in a different region.

1. Select **Create** and wait for your project, including the gpt-4 model deployment you selected, to be created.
1. In the navigation pane on the left, select **Overview** to see the main page for your project.
1. In the **Endpoints and keys** area, ensure that the **Azure AI Foundry** library is selected and view the **Azure AI Foundry project endpoint**.
1. **Save** the endpoint in a notepad. You'll use this endpoint to connect to your project in a client application.

### Connect Application Insights

Connect Application Insights to your project in Azure AI Foundry to start collecting data for analysis.

1. Use the menu on the left, and select the **Tracing** page.
1. **Create a new** Application Insights resource to connect to your app.
1. Enter an Application Insights resource name and select **Create**.

Application Insights is now connected to your project, and data will begin to be collected for analysis.

## Run a generative AI app with the Cloud Shell

You'll connect to your Azure AI Foundry project from Azure Cloud Shell and programmatically interact with a deployed model as part of a generative AI application.

### Interact with a deployed model

Start by retrieving the necessary information to be authenticated to interact with your deployed model. Then, you'll access the Azure Cloud Shell and update the code of your generative AI app.

1. Open a new browser tab (keeping the Azure AI Foundry portal open in the existing tab).
1. In the new tab, browse to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`; signing in with your Azure credentials if prompted.
1. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment with no storage in your subscription.
1. In the Cloud Shell toolbar, in the **Settings** menu, select **Go to Classic version**.

    **<font color="red">Ensure you've switched to the Classic version of the Cloud Shell before continuing.</font>**

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, enter and run the following commands:

    ```
    rm -r mslearn-genaiops -f
    git clone https://github.com/microsoftlearning/mslearn-genaiops mslearn-genaiops
    ```

    This command clones the GitHub repository containing the code files for this exercise.

1. After the repo has been cloned, navigate to the folder containing the application code files:  

    ```
   cd mslearn-genaiops/Files/08
    ```

1. In the Cloud Shell command-line pane, enter the following command to install the libraries you need:

    ```
   python -m venv labenv
   ./labenv/bin/Activate.ps1
   pip install python-dotenv openai azure-identity azure-ai-projects azure-ai-inference azure-monitor-opentelemetry
    ```

1. Enter the following command to open the configuration file that has been provided:

    ```
   code .env
    ```

    The file is opened in a code editor.

1. In the code file:

    1. In the code file, replace the **your_project_endpoint** placeholder with the endpoint for your project (copied from the project **Overview** page in the Azure AI Foundry portal).
    1. Replace the **your_model_deployment** placeholder with the name you assigned to your GPT-4o model deployment (by default `gpt-4o`).

1. *After* you've replaced the placeholders, in the code editor, use the **CTRL+S** command or **Right-click > Save** to **save your changes** and then use the **CTRL+Q** command or **Right-click > Quit** to close the code editor while keeping the cloud shell command line open.

### Update the code for your generative AI app

Now that your environment is set up and your .env file is configured, it's time to prepare your AI assistant script for execution. Next to connecting with an AI project and enabling Application Insights, you need to:

- Interact with your deployed model.
- Define the function to specify your prompt.
- Define the main flow that calls all functions.

You will add these three parts to a starting script.

1. Run the following command to **open the script** that has been provided:

    ```
   code start-prompt.py
    ```

    You'll see that several key lines have been left blank or marked with empty # Comments. Your task is to complete the script by copying and pasting the correct lines below into the appropriate locations.

1. In the script, locate **# Function to call the model and handle tracing**.
1. Below this comment, paste the following code:

    ```
   # Function to call the model and handle tracing
   def call_model(system_prompt, user_prompt, span_name):
       with tracer.start_as_current_span(span_name) as span:
           span.set_attribute("session.id", SESSION_ID)
           span.set_attribute("prompt.user", user_prompt)
           start_time = time.time()
    
           response = chat_client.chat.completions.create(
               model=model_deployment,
               messages=[
                   { 
                       "role": "system", 
                       "content": system_prompt 
                   },
                   { 
                       "role": "user", 
                       "content": user_prompt
                   }
               ]
           )
    
           duration = time.time() - start_time
           output = response.choices[0].message.content
           span.set_attribute("response.time", duration)
           span.set_attribute("response.tokens", len(output.split()))
           return output
    ```

1. In the script, locate **# Function to recommend a hike based on user preferences**.
1. Below this comment, paste the following code:

    ```
   # Function to recommend a hike based on user preferences 
   def recommend_hike(preferences):
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("recommend_hike") as span:
            prompt = f"""
            Recommend a named hiking trail based on the following user preferences.
            Provide only the name of the trail and a one-sentence summary.
            Preferences: {preferences}
            """
            response = call_model(
                "You are an expert hiking trail recommender.",
                prompt,
                "recommend_model_call"
            )
            span.set_attribute("hike_recommendation", response.strip())
            return response.strip()
    ```

1. In the script, locate **# ---- Main Flow ----**.
1. Below this comment, paste the following code:

    ```
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       with tracer.start_as_current_span("trail_guide_session") as session_span:
           session_span.set_attribute("session.id", SESSION_ID)
           print("\n--- Trail Guide AI Assistant ---")
           preferences = input("Tell me what kind of hike you're looking for (location, difficulty, scenery):\n> ")

           hike = recommend_hike(preferences)
           print(f"\n‚úÖ Recommended Hike: {hike}")

           # Run profile function


           # Run match product function


           print(f"\nüîç Trace ID available in Application Insights for session: {SESSION_ID}")
    ```

1. **Save the changes** you made in the script.
1. In the Cloud Shell command-line pane beneath the code editor, enter the following command to **run the script**:

    ```
   python start-prompt.py
    ```

1. Give some description of the kind of hike you're looking for, for example:

    ```
   A one-day hike in the mountains
    ```

    The model will generate a response, which will be captured with Application Insights. You can visualize the traces in the **Azure AI Foundry portal**.

> **Note**: It may take a few minutes for monitoring data to show in Azure Monitor.

## View traces data in the Azure AI Foundry portal

After running the script, you captured a trace of your AI application‚Äôs execution. Now you'll explore it using Application Insights in Azure AI Foundry.

> **Note:** Later, you'll run the code again, and view the traces in the Azure AI Foundry portal again. Let's first explore where to find the traces to visualize them.

### Navigate to the Azure AI Foundry portal

1. **Keep you Cloud Shell open!** You'll come back to this to update the code and run it again.
1. Navigate to the tab in your browser with the **Azure AI Foundry portal** open.
1. Use the menu on the left, select **Tracing**.
1. *If* no data is shown, **refresh** your view.
1. Select the trace **train_guide_session** to open a new window that shows more details.

### Review your trace

This view shows the trace for one full session of the Trail Guide AI Assistant.

- **Top-level span**: trail_guide_session
    This is the parent span. It represents the entire execution of your assistant from start to finish.

- **Nested child spans**:
    Each indented line represents a nested operation. You‚Äôll find:

    - **recommend_hike** which captures your logic to decide on a hike.
    - **recommend_model_call** which is the span created by call_model() inside recommend_hike.
    - **chat gpt-4o** which is automatically instrumented by the Azure AI Inference SDK to show actual LLM interaction.

1. You can click on any span to view:

    1. Its duration.
    1. Its attributes like user prompt, tokens used, response time.
    1. Any errors or custom data attached with **span.set_attribute(...)**.

## Add more functions to your code

1. Navigate to the tab in your browser with the **Azure Portal** open.
1. Run the following command to **re-open the script:**

    ```
   code start-prompt.py
    ```

1. In the script, locate **# Function to generate a trip profile for the recommended hike**.
1. Below this comment, paste the following code:

    ```
   def generate_trip_profile(hike_name):
       with tracer.start_as_current_span("trip_profile_generation") as span:
           prompt = f"""
           Hike: {hike_name}
           Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object and nothing else.
           Do not include any intro text, commentary, or markdown formatting.
           Format: {{ "trailType": ..., "typicalWeather": ..., "recommendedGear": [ ... ] }}
           """
           response = call_model(
               "You are an AI assistant that returns structured hiking trip data in JSON format.",
               prompt,
               "trip_profile_model_call"
           )
           print("üîç Raw model response:", response)
           try:
               profile = json.loads(response)
               span.set_attribute("profile.success", True)
               return profile
           except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
               print("‚ùå JSON decode error:", e)
               span.set_attribute("profile.success", False)
               return {}
    ```

1. In the script, locate **# Function to match recommended gear with products in the catalog**.
1. Below this comment, paste the following code:

    ```
   def match_products(recommended_gear):
       with tracer.start_as_current_span("product_matching") as span:
           matched = []
           for gear_item in recommended_gear:
               for product in mock_product_catalog:
                   if any(word in product.lower() for word in gear_item.lower().split()):
                       matched.append(product)
                       break
           span.set_attribute("matched.count", len(matched))
           return matched
    ```

1. In the script, locate **# Run profile function**.
1. Below and **aligned with** this comment, paste the following code:

    ```
           profile = generate_trip_profile(hike)
           if not profile:
               print("Failed to generate trip profile. Please check Application Insights for trace.")
               exit(1)

           print(f"\nüìã Trip Profile for {hike}:")
           print(json.dumps(profile, indent=2))
    ```

1. In the script, locate **# Run match product function**.
1. Below and **aligned with** this comment, paste the following code:

    ```
           matched = match_products(profile.get("recommendedGear", []))
           print("\nüõí Recommended Products from Lakeshore Retail:")
           print("\n".join(matched))
    ```

1. **Save the changes** you made in the script.
1. In the Cloud Shell command-line pane beneath the code editor, enter the following command to **run the script**:

    ```
   python start-prompt.py
    ```

1. Give some description of the kind of hike you're looking for, for example:

    ```
   I want to go for a multi-day adventure along the beach
    ```

<details>
<summary><b>Solution script</b>: In case your code is not working.</summary><br>
<p>If you inspect the LLM trace for the generate_trip_profile function, you'll notice that the assistant's response includes backticks and the word json to format the output as a code block.

While this is helpful for display, it causes issues in the code because the output is no longer valid JSON. This leads to a parsing error during further processing.

The error is likely caused by how the LLM is instructed to adhere to a specific format for its output. Including the instructions in the user prompt appears more effective than to put it in the system prompt.</p>
</details>


> **Note**: It may take a few minutes for monitoring data to show in Azure Monitor.

### View the new traces in the Azure AI Foundry portal

1. Navigate back to the Azure AI Foundry portal.
1. A new trace with the same name **trail_guide_session** should appear. Refresh your view if necesary.
1. Select the new trace to open the more detailed view.
1. Review the new nested child spans **trip_profile_generation** and **product_matching**.
1. Select **product_matching** and review the metadata that appears.

    In the product_matching function, you included **span.set_attribute("matched.count", len(matched))**. By setting the attribute with the key-value pair **matched.count** and the length of the variable matched, you added this information to the **product_matching** trace. You can find this key-value pair under **attributes** in the metadata.

## (OPTIONAL) Trace an error

If you have extra time, you can review how to use traces when you have an error. A script that is likely to throw an error is provided to you. Run it and review the traces.

This is an exercise designed to challenge you, which means instructions are intentionally less detailed.

1. In the Cloud Shell, open the **error-prompt.py** script. This script is located in the same directory as the **start-prompt.py** script. Review its content.
1. Run the **error-prompt.py** script. Provide an answer in the command-line when prompted.
1. *Hopefully*, the output message includes **Failed to generate trip profile. Please check Application Insights for trace.**.
1. Navigate to the trace for the **trip_profile_generation** and inspect why there was an error.
